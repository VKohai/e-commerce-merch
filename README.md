## User Experience (UX)

Customers can easy see new products in the showcase on the main page and navigate to the product details page by clicking the details button. On the product details page customers can see description and gallery of the product. Also it is possible to choose product options before adding it to the shopping cart. On the shopping cart page customers can see products that they have added and total price. By clicking the pay button they navigate to the payment page where they fills out payment information and can pay the order.

## Features
The webapp is made on React.JS. React.JS is a library that allows to build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.

* Showcase slider to see new products.
* Product gallery to see photos of the product.
* Routing between pages.
* Communication with server (see [on the repo](https://github.com/VKohai/Ecommerce) written in C# by me) through REST API using Redux Toolkit to get products from the server and send orders to database on the server.
